# EDI Portfolio â€“ 850 Purchase Order Example

This repository showcases a complete **EDI mapping and transformation workflow** using an **EDI 850 Purchase Order** document.  
It demonstrates how raw EDI data is mapped, transformed, and validated into a structured format for downstream systems.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Overview

1. **Inbound EDI 850**  
   File received in `.edi` format from trading partner.

2. **Mapping**  
   - `mapping_spec.csv` defines how each EDI segment/element maps to business fields.  
   - `mapping_doc_850.md` provides documentation of the mapping rules.

3. **Transformation**  
   - `transform.py` simulates mapping logic.  
   - Outputs a clean `.csv` file (`output_sample.csv`) for easy consumption.

4. **Workflow Integration**  
   - `inbound_bpml_example.xml` shows how Sterling Integrator (SI) could orchestrate the process.  
   - Steps: pickup â†’ validate â†’ transform â†’ send to ERP.
